Topics to cover

* DSCP and other various readings conducted since last week

* Design documents produced
	sys arch
	user stories

* HTTP ECN proto
	kernel is opinionated about the usage of ecn
	doesnt support using 'alternative' codepoints

	setsockopt doesnt actually do anything at all wrt ecn
	man page seemed to confirm this

	libnetfilter_queue as an alternative
	kernel has produced packets, can intercept and modify
	very involved but an extensible solution
		Makes ECT1 vs ECT0 almost trivial
	

* Internalisation of tcpdump almost working
	Actually just needs threaded
	if we read back responses -> synchronisation is nearly trivial
