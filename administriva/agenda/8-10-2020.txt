Items to discuss:

Github and gitlab are now up and running with filled in timelogs
	- Issue with 2nd machine prevented pushing for a little while
	  fixed now and timelog from friday has been pushed

	- Read parts of the ECN RFC to refresh knowledge on ECN negotiation

	- Looked into available quic implementations, one which has C bindings
	  is lsquic -> also supports ECN as defined in the more recent RFC drafts :)

	- Recursively read through some of the cited papers from is ECN Usable paper

	- Found papers on a very interesting tool called tracebox, which given RFC xyz
	  compliant routers can give a good guess at where IP Packets are being altered
	  on path, without the need for control of endpoints

	- Began planning out a timeline of events of when i expect things to happen
	  ie. good plan to get most if not al of the actual coding done before the end
	  of the semester -> experiement can be run over the xmas period

	  Although it could be beneficial to get the experiment done over the crunch period
	  That frees analysis over the xmas period

	  and likely is not a massive amount to code before then

	  some analysis over xmas, dissertation writing and evaluation of results over the 2nd semester


Scope and directions

 - Continued to think on the scope and directions for the overall dissertation
 - Particularly for SIP/RTP negotiation, does there exist an extnesive dataset for us to test?
 	- Could have a comparison with SIP/RTSP but this likely straining on points available for a 10 week deadline
 - TCP Dump despite being fairly clunky may actually be decent pcap format is ammenable under other tools particularly for analysis
   rather than implementing an in tool solution which may appear slightly neater

 - I propose propose the project scoping as (IPv4 + IPv6) x (TCP + Quic) looking at differential reachability
   as a measure a the ease of use of ECN under these technologies

 - For instances of where ECN is not available for these technolgies
 	- Investigate whether the host does or does not support ECN
	- Investigate where on the Path the ECN is stripped as reported by either the AS number and potentially the network device in question
	  Using either path-spider of tracebox

	- Is it always the case that where ECN is not supported on TCP that quic is the same case?
	- Is UDP a more permissable substrate in terms of ECN deployment

Other sorts of questions

- 210 traces in "is ECN usable with UDP thingy"
