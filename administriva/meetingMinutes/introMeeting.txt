Introduction to the project;

Designing network transport protocols
ECN helps with the deployment of these systems

Big vendors are driving for this to be turned on
apples experiment to test whether ECN works with a given connection

establish ECN connections to see whether it works or not, TCP connections to probably web servers
slightly fancier to do it with other transport layer technologies
	quic or udp
	using different protocols and ports, particularly around conferencing stacks RTP

Final extension, finding where on the network it is being stripped from the packets
will probably be a modified version of traceroute, can be inferred from the AS number
although there are issues around using things this way -> cited in is UDP usable

QUIC comparison with TCP may be a valid avenue, in terms of ECN acceptance on the network
and may well be publishable given quic nearing completion

RFC-6679 for ecn with rtp
quic uses ECN look at the RFC for this as well

Path spider - large scale measurement tool may be useful for discovering where
stuff is going
Potential to get it published in a variety of bodes

Software tool will likely be the easier part of the experiment
however we are looking for representative samples of hosts that are distributed
and easily available and run a variety of protocols

possiblity to run tests from several hosts to gauge a representative sample
amazon EC2 hosts that are distributed across many different datacentres

routing over a VPN is another potential option, given that we can easily switch locations
hopefully no vpn provider trickery removing ECN?


Dissertation structure will contain a software section, however this will probably be dwarfed by the evaluation
of the tool and results + conclusion

relook at the is UDP usable and look at the references.
