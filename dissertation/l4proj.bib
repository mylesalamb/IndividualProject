	abstract = {Better exposing congestion can improve traﬃc management in the wide-area, at peering points, among residential broadband connections, and in the data center. TCP’s network utilization and eﬃciency depends on congestion information, while recent research proposes economic and policy models based on congestion. Such motivations have driven widespread support of Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (ECN) in modern operating systems. We reappraise the Internet’s ECN readiness, updating and extending previous measurements. Across large and diverse server populations, we ﬁnd a three-fold increase in ECN support over prior studies. Using new methods, we characterize ECN within mobile infrastructure and at the client-side, populations previously unmeasured. Via large-scale path measurements, we ﬁnd the ECN feedback loop failing in the core of the network 40\% of the time, typically at AS boundaries. Finally, we discover new examples of infrastructure violating ECN Internet standards, and discuss remaining impediments to running ECN while suggesting mechanisms to aid adoption.},

	abstract = {The differentiated service architecture (DiffServ) provides a means for network devices to classify traffic based on the DiffServ codepoint (DSCP) and to map the traffic to a specific QoS forwarding treatment. Successful use beyond the local network depends on consistent remarking and forwarding of the DSCP value inside and at the boundaries of DiffServ domains. This paper provides the results of a new widescale measurement campaign to examine how the DSCP value is altered as packets travel along a set of Internet paths. This allows us to infer whether a packet is likely to receive an appropriate QoS treatment and to comment the opportunities for more widely deploying DiffServ QoS. Our results identify a set of remarking pathologies, revealing that many deployed routers continue to use the previous semantics of the deprecated Type of Service (ToS) field. We also note that is not common to observe clearing of the bits in the DiffServ field, as previously believed for routers in the core of the Internet, although this varies significantly depending on the type of network studied. Our results are related to recent IETF work that recommends use of specific DSCP values.},

In this article, we will describe a tool called Tracebox that helps in detecting middleboxes.

The traditional end-to-end assumptions about the Internet are increasingly challenged by the introduction of intermediary network elements (middleboxes) that intentionally or unintentionally prevent or alter the behavior of end-to-end communications. This paper provides measurement results showing the impact of the current network environment on a number of traditional and proposed protocol mechanisms (e.g., Path MTU Discovery, Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation, etc.). We present results of measurements taken using an active measurement framework to study web servers. We analyze our results to gain further understanding of the differences between the behavior of the Internet in theory versus the behavior we observed through measurements. In addition, these measurements can be used to guide the deﬁnition of more realistic Internet modeling scenarios.},

This measurement study provides an update on deployment status and newly assesses the marginal risk of enabling ECN negotiation by default on client end-systems. Additionally, we dig deeper into causes of connectivity and negotiation issues linked to ECN. We find that about five websites per thousand suffer additional connection setup latency when fallback per RFC 3168 is correctly implemented; we provide a patch for Linux to properly perform this fallback. Moreover, we detect and explore a number of cases in which ECN brokenness is clearly path-dependent, i.e. on middleboxes beyond the access or content provider network. Further analysis of these cases can guide their elimination, further reducing the risk of enabling ECN by default.},

Using measurements from the author’s homes, their workplace, and cloud servers in each of the nine EC2 regions worldwide, we test reachability of 2500 servers from the public NTP server pool, using ECT(0) and not-ECT marked UDP packets. We show that an average of 98.97\% of the NTP servers that are reachable using not-ECT marked packets are also reachable using ECT(0) marked UDP packets, and that {\textasciitilde}98\% of network hops pass ECT(0) marked packets without clearing the ECT bits. We compare reachability of the same hosts using ECN with TCP, ﬁnding that 82.0\% of those reachable with TCP can successfully negotiate and use ECN. Our ﬁndings suggest that ECN is broadly usable with UDP trafﬁc, and that support for use of ECN with TCP has increased.},
