	abstract = {Better exposing congestion can improve traﬃc management in the wide-area, at peering points, among residential broadband connections, and in the data center. TCP’s network utilization and eﬃciency depends on congestion information, while recent research proposes economic and policy models based on congestion. Such motivations have driven widespread support of Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (ECN) in modern operating systems. We reappraise the Internet’s ECN readiness, updating and extending previous measurements. Across large and diverse server populations, we ﬁnd a three-fold increase in ECN support over prior studies. Using new methods, we characterize ECN within mobile infrastructure and at the client-side, populations previously unmeasured. Via large-scale path measurements, we ﬁnd the ECN feedback loop failing in the core of the network 40\% of the time, typically at AS boundaries. Finally, we discover new examples of infrastructure violating ECN Internet standards, and discuss remaining impediments to running ECN while suggesting mechanisms to aid adoption.},

Successful use beyond the local network depends on consistent remarking and forwarding of the DSCP value inside and at the boundaries of DiffServ domains. This paper provides the results of a new widescale measurement campaign to examine how the DSCP value is altered as packets travel along a set of Internet paths. This allows us to infer whether a packet is likely to receive an appropriate QoS treatment and to comment the opportunities for more widely deploying DiffServ QoS. Our results identify a set of remarking pathologies, revealing that many deployed routers continue to use the previous semantics of the deprecated Type of Service (ToS) field. We also note that is not common to observe clearing of the bits in the DiffServ field, as previously believed for routers in the core of the Internet, although this varies significantly depending on the type of network studied. Our results are related to recent IETF work that recommends use of specific DSCP values.},

Our method extends prior device ﬁngerprinting techniques to improve their feasibility in modern environments, and uses them to support measurement-based detection of sibling interfaces. We validate our technique against a diverse set of 61 web servers with known sibling addresses and ﬁnd it to be over 97\% accurate with 99\% precision. Finally, we apply the technique to characterize the top ∼6,400 Alexa IPv6-capable web domains, and discover that a DNS name in common does not imply that the corresponding IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are on the same machine, network, or even autonomous system. Understanding sibling and non-sibling relationships gives insight not only into IPv6 deployment and evolution, but also helps characterize the potential for correlated failures and susceptibility to certain attacks.},

We find that about five websites per thousand suffer additional connection setup latency when fallback per RFC 3168 is correctly implemented; we provide a patch for Linux to properly perform this fallback. Moreover, we detect and explore a number of cases in which ECN brokenness is clearly path-dependent, i.e. on middleboxes beyond the access or content provider network.

Using measurements from the author’s homes, their workplace, and cloud servers in each of the nine EC2 regions worldwide, we test reachability of 2500 servers from the public NTP server pool, using ECT(0) and not-ECT marked UDP packets. We show that an average of 98.97\% of the NTP servers that are reachable using not-ECT marked packets are also reachable using ECT(0) marked UDP packets, and that {\textasciitilde}98\% of network hops pass ECT(0) marked packets without clearing the ECT bits. We compare reachability of the same hosts using ECN with TCP, ﬁnding that 82.0\% of those reachable with TCP can successfully negotiate and use ECN.

While middleboxes provide in-network functionality that is necessary to keep networks manageable and economically viable, any packet mangling – whether essential for the needed functionality or accidental as an unwanted side eﬀect – makes it more and more diﬃcult to deploy new protocols or extensions of existing protocols. For the evolution of the protocol stack, it is important to know which network impairments exist and potentially need to be worked around. While classical network measurement tools are often focused on absolute performance values, we present a new measurement tool, called PATHspider that performs A/B testing between two diﬀerent protocols or different protocol extensions to perform controlled experiments of protocol-dependent connectivity problems as well as differential treatment. PATHspider is a framework for performing and analyzing these measurements, while the actual A/B test can be easily customized. This paper describes the basic design approach and architecture of PATHspider and gives guidance how to use and customize it.},

	abstract = {RFC 792 requires most ICMP error messages to quote the IP header and the next eight bytes of the packet to which the ICMP error message applies. The quoted packet is used by the receiver to match the ICMP message to an appropriate process. An operating system may examine the quoted source and destination IP addresses, IP protocol, and source and destination port numbers to determine the socket or process corresponding to the ICMP message. In an idealised end-to-end Internet, the portion of the packet quoted should be the same as that which was sent, except for the IP TTL, DSCP, ECN bits, and checksum fields. In the modern Internet, this may not always be the case. This paper presents an analysis of ICMP quotations where the quote does not match the probe.},

	abstract = {Although traceroute has the potential to discover AS links that are invisible to existing BGP monitors, it is well known that
the common approach for mapping router IP address to AS number (IP2AS) based on the longest prefix matching is highly error-prone. In this paper we conduct a systematic investigation into the potential errors of the IP2AS mapping
for AS topology inference. In comparing traceroute-derived AS paths and BGP AS paths, we take a novel approach of identifying
mismatch fragments between each path pair. We then identify the origin and cause of each mismatch with a systematic set of
tests based on publicly available data sets. Our results show that about 60\% of mismatches are due to IP address sharing between
peering BGP routers in neighboring ASes, and only about 14\% of the mismatches are caused by the presence of IXPs, siblings,
or prefixes with multiple origin ASes. This result helps clarify an argument that comes from previous work regarding the major
cause of errors in converting traceroute paths to AS paths. Our results also show that between 16\% and 47\% of AS adjacencies
in two public repositories for traceroute-derived topology are false.},
