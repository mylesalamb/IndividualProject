# Datasets

Contained within this folder are the datasets used within the projects deployment.

flight.ip4.dataset is similar to flight.dataset, although does not contain any ipv6 addresses as this alleviates a known issue with the network analysis tool where IPv4 vantage points encounter some undefined behaviour in attmepting to connect to an IPv6 host.

the file domains.filter.dataset was provided by the University of Toulousse with there domain blacklist, available here https://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/index_en.php
