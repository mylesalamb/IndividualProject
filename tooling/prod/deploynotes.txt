Things to do when deploying on a new system

- Ensure that libnetfilter_queue (> 1.0.5)
    - Bugs do not appear to be present in its dependencies
- Alter runtime linker so that the library can be accessed from the default install location
- Ensure that iptables setup.sh is run to start the jit packet modifier
