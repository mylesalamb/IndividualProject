For testing ECN with RTP we may not actually have to start a full session
ECN use with RTP is negotiated using SIP or equivalent before the beginning
of the session. However, to actually test in practive whether RTP packets
will have their ECN capability stripped, this will need to be actually tested

ECN not commonly used with UDP paper tests the feasability of this approach
considering the option of comparing ip/TCP and ip/QUIC is probably a suitable
extension of this approach

Cannot test the return path, which may be different from the sender path
as we do not control the NTP servers - What is this called again?

"210 such traces" - Repeated 210 times? as network paths change to get the average availability i would assume

Differential reachability is probably the most important measure going forward for comparing the results
of the independant varaible - Network protocols / versions that are used

section 3.4 discusses ICMP TTL exceeded echoing back the header of the packet
this is what should be done to detect whether the ECT bits are being stripped [20]
